Day 6 Task: File Permissions and Access Control Lists
Today is more on Reading, Learning, and Implementing File Permissions

The concept of Linux file permission and ownership is important in Linux. Today, we will work on Linux permissions and ownership, and perform tasks related to both.

Tasks

Understanding File Permissions:

Create a simple file and run ls -ltr to see the details of the files. Refer to Notes
Each of the three permissions are assigned to three defined categories of users. The categories are:
Owner: The owner of the file or application.
Use chown to change the ownership permission of a file or directory.
Group: The group that owns the file or application.
Use chgrp to change the group permission of a file or directory.
Others: All users with access to the system (outside the users in a group).
Use chmod to change the other users' permissions of a file or directory.
Task: Change the user permissions of the file and note the changes after running ls -ltr.
Writing an Article:

Write an article about file permissions based on your understanding from the notes.
Access Control Lists (ACL):

Read about ACL and try out the commands getfacl and setfacl.
Task: Create a directory and set specific ACL permissions for different users and groups. Verify the permissions using getfacl.
Additional Tasks:

Task: Create a script that changes the permissions of multiple files in a directory based on user input.
Task: Write a script that sets ACL permissions for a user on a given file, based on user input.
Understanding Sticky Bit, SUID, and SGID:

Read about sticky bit, SUID, and SGID.
Task: Create examples demonstrating the use of sticky bit, SUID, and SGID, and explain their significance.
Backup and Restore Permissions:

Task: Create a script that backs up the current permissions of files in a directory to a file.
Task: Create another script that restores the permissions from the backup file.
